# Web Development Basics: HTML

This document provides an overview of fundamental web development concepts, focusing on HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the backbone of any webpage, providing the structure and content, while CSS handles the styling and JavaScript provides the logic.

## 💻 HTML: The Building Blocks of the Web:-

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the code used to structure a webpage and its content. The components used to design the structure of websites are called

HTML tags.
         The default filename for a website's homepage is typically

HTML is not case-sensitive. For example,

M is the same as m.

: This declaration tells the browser that you're using HTML5. : This is the root element of an HTML document. It is the parent of the and tags. : This is a container for metadata, which is information about the document that isn't displayed on the page. <title>: Sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab. : This tag contains all the data that is rendered and displayed by the browser.

## 📝 Common HTML Tags and Attributes

i want to underline a specific word in readme.md at my github so suggest me shortcutkeys to underline and many other shortcutkeys with their references

GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) does not have a dedicated shortcut key or native syntax for underlining text. However, you can use HTML tags directly within your Markdown file to achieve this.



Underline Text in Markdown

To underline a specific word or phrase, use the HTML tag:

HTML

This is some underlined text.

Other Useful Markdown & HTML Shortcuts

While there are no universal "shortcut keys" like you'd find in a word processor, you can use the following Markdown syntax and HTML tags to format your text.

Emphasis



Bold: Use two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) around the text.

bold text or bold text



Italic: Use a single asterisk (*) or a single underscore (_) around the text.

strikethrough text



Headings

Use the hash symbol (#) followed by a space at the beginning of a line to create headings. The number of hashes determines the heading level (1-6).

Heading 1



Heading 2



Heading 3

Lists

Unordered List: Use an asterisk (*), a plus sign (+), or a hyphen (-) followed by a space.



Item 1

Item 2

Ordered List: Use a number followed by a period (.) and a space.

First item

Second item

Links & Images

Links: Use square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL.



Link Text

Images: Add an exclamation mark (!) before the link syntax.





Code



Inline Code: Use a single backtick (`) around the text.

This is some code within a sentence.



Code Block: Use three backticks (```) on the lines before and after the code. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting.

JavaScript



// Your code here

Horizontal Rule

Use three hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

not in html in .md language



There is no native Markdown syntax for underlining text. However, you can achieve this by directly using HTML tags within your Markdown file, as Markdown is designed to be a superset of HTML.

Underlining in Markdown

To underline text in a Markdown file, you can use the HTML tag.

Markdown

This is an underlined word.

This is the standard and most reliable method for underlining text in a .md file on platforms like GitHub.

Other Markdown Formatting

While underlining isn't a direct Markdown feature, here are some common formatting options with their respective syntax:

Bold: text or text

Italic: text or text



Bold and Italic: text

Strikethrough: text



Headings: Use # for heading 1, ## for heading 2, and so on, up to ######.

Lists:



Unordered: Use *, +, or - followed by a space.

Ordered: Use 1., 2., 3., etc.



Code:

Inline code: Use a single backtick (`).



Code block: Use three backticks (````).

Links: Link Text



Images:

Blockquotes: Use > at the beginning of the line.



For more advanced formatting, such as changing font size or color, you will also need to use HTML and CSS directly within your Markdown file.

# Web Development Basics: HTML
> This document provides an overview of fundamental web development concepts, focusing on HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the backbone of any webpage, providing the structure and content, while CSS handles the styling and JavaScript provides the logic. 

## üíª HTML: The Building Blocks of the Web

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the code used to structure a webpage and its content. The components used to design the structure of websites are called 


## HTML tags.

The default filename for a website's homepage is typically

index.html 

### HTML tag is a container for content or other HTML tags. For example, a paragraph is an element with an opening 

 > <p> tag and a closing </p> tag, with the content in between.

> Most HTML elements have both an opening and a closing tag with content in between. Some tags, like 

 > <br> for a line break, don't have content and are self-closing.


> HTML is not case-sensitive.
For example, 
>> M is the same as m.
>> <html> is same the <HTML>

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Basic HTML Page Structure
A basic HTML document has a specific structure:
                                                <!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration tells the browser that you're using HTML5.
                                                
  <html>: This is the root element of an HTML document. It is the parent of the 

>> <head> and <body> tags.
<head>: This is a container for metadata, which is information about the document that isn't displayed on the page.

>> <title>: Sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.

>>  <body>: This tag contains all the data that is rendered and displayed by the browser.

## üìù Common HTML Tags and Attributes

# HTML Attributes: Attributes are used to add more information to a tag. For example, 

>> <html lang="en"> specifies the language of the document as English.

>> Heading Tags (<h1> to <h6>): Used to display headings. 

>> <h1> is the most important heading, and <h6> is the least important.

>> Paragraph Tag (<p>): Used for adding paragraphs to your page.

>> Anchor Tag (<a>): Used to create links.

Example: 
>>  <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>.

Use 
>> target="_main" to open a link in a new tab.

>>You can also make an image a clickable link by wrapping the 
>> <img> tag inside an <a> tag.

Image Tag (<img>): Used to add images.

Example: 
        <img src="/image.png" alt="Random Image">. The 

 src attribute specifies the image source, which can be a relative URL.You can set the height and width of an image using attributes, like 

>> <img src="link" height=50px> or <img src="link" width=50px>.

Line Break Tag (<br>): Adds a line break, or a next line, to your page.

## Text Formatting Tags:
                   
  <b> for bold text.
  
  <i> for italic text.
  
  <u> for <u>underline</u> text.
  
  <big> for bigger text.
  
  <small> for smaller text.
  
<sub> for <sub>subscript</sub> text (e.g., H_2O).

<sup> for <sup>superscript</sup> text (e.g., A +B).

Horizontal Ruler (<hr>): Displays a horizontal line to separate content.

Preformatted Text (<pre>): Displays text exactly as it's written in the code, preserving spaces and line breaks.

## üì¶ Block vs. Inline Elements
Elements can be categorized as block-level or inline-level.

Block-Level Elements: These elements take up the full width available and start on a new line. The 

<div> tag is a common block-level container for other elements. * 

  Inline-Level Elements: These elements only take up as much width as their content needs and do not start on a new line. The 

<span> tag is a common inline-level container.

## üìÑ HTML Layout and Structure

Semantic Tags: Using the right tags for the right purpose helps with page layout and readability. Examples include 

<header>, <main>, and <footer>.

Inside the <main> tag:

<section>: For a section on your page.

<article>: For an article.

<aside>: For content that is "aside" from the main content, like an ad.

## üìÇ Lists and Tables

Lists (<ul> and <ol>): Used to represent list data.

Unordered List (<ul>): Displays a bulleted list. Each item is an 

<li> tag.

Ordered List (<ol>): Displays a numbered list. Each item is also an 

<li> tag.

Tables (<table>): Used to represent data in a table format.

<u> <tr>: Used for a table row. </u>

<td>: Used for table data.

<th>: Used for a table header.

<caption>: Adds a caption to the table.

<thead> and <tbody>: Used to wrap the table head and body, respectively.

colspan attribute: Allows a cell to span across multiple columns.


## üìù Forms and User Input

> Forms (<form>) are used to collect data from users, such as for sign-ups or login pages.

> Input (<input>): A common form element for user input. The 

> type attribute specifies the type of input, such as "text" or "radio". The 

> placeholder attribute provides a hint to the user.

> Label (<label>): Used to associate a label with a form control.

> Checkbox (<input type="checkbox">): Allows users to select one or more options.

> Textarea (<textarea>): Creates a multi-line text input area.

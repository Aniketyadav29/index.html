# Web Development Basics: HTML
This document provides an overview of fundamental web development concepts, focusing on HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the backbone of any webpage, providing the structure and content, while CSS handles the styling and JavaScript provides the logic. 

## üíª HTML: The Building Blocks of the Web

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the code used to structure a webpage and its content. The components used to design the structure of websites are called 


HTML tags.

The default filename for a website's homepage is typically 

index.html.

An 

HTML tag is a container for content or other HTML tags. For example, a paragraph is an element with an opening 

<p> tag and a closing </p> tag, with the content in between.

Most HTML elements have both an opening and a closing tag with content in between. Some tags, like 

<br> for a line break, don't have content and are self-closing.


HTML is 

not case-sensitive. For example, 

<html> is the same as <HTML>.

üõ†Ô∏è Basic HTML Page Structure
A basic HTML document has a specific structure:


<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration tells the browser that you're using HTML5.



<html>: This is the root element of an HTML document. It is the parent of the 


<head> and <body> tags.


<head>: This is a container for metadata, which is information about the document that isn't displayed on the page.



<title>: Sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.


<body>: This tag contains all the data that is rendered and displayed by the browser.

üìù Common HTML Tags and Attributes

HTML Attributes: Attributes are used to add more information to a tag. For example, 

<html lang="en"> specifies the language of the document as English.


Heading Tags (<h1> to <h6>): Used to display headings. 

<h1> is the most important heading, and <h6> is the least important.


Paragraph Tag (<p>): Used for adding paragraphs to your page.


Anchor Tag (<a>): Used to create links.

Example: 

<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>.

Use 

target="_main" to open a link in a new tab.

You can also make an image a clickable link by wrapping the 

<img> tag inside an <a> tag.


Image Tag (<img>): Used to add images.

Example: 

<img src="/image.png" alt="Random Image">. The 

src attribute specifies the image source, which can be a relative URL.

You can set the height and width of an image using attributes, like 

<img src="link" height=50px> or <img src="link" width=50px>.



Line Break Tag (<br>): Adds a line break, or a next line, to your page.

Text Formatting Tags:


<b> for bold text.


<i> for italic text.


<u> for <u>underline</u> text.


<big> for bigger text.


<small> for smaller text.


<sub> for <sub>subscript</sub> text (e.g., H_2O).


<sup> for <sup>superscript</sup> text (e.g., A 
n
 +B).


Horizontal Ruler (<hr>): Displays a horizontal line to separate content.


Preformatted Text (<pre>): Displays text exactly as it's written in the code, preserving spaces and line breaks.

üì¶ Block vs. Inline Elements
| Category | Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Block-Level** | `<div>` | Takes up the full width available and starts on a new line. It's a common container for other elements. |
| **Inline-Level** | `<span>` | Takes only as much width as its content needs and does not start on a new line. It's a common container for other elements. |
| **Semantic Tags** | `<header>` | Used to define the header of a page or section. |
| | `<main>` | Used to define the main content of a document. |
| | `<footer>` | Used to define the footer of a page or section. |
| **Inside `<main>`** | `<section>` | Used for a section on your page. |
| | `<article>` | Used for an article on your page. |
| | `<aside>` | Used for content aside from the main content, such as advertisements. |
üìÇ Lists and Tables

# üíª Lists & Tables in HTML

This document provides a quick reference for HTML tags used to create lists and tables.

## üìù Lists
[cite_start]Lists are used to represent real-life list data[cite: 155].

| Category | Tag | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unordered List** | `<ul>` | [cite_start]Displays a bulleted list[cite: 156, 157]. |
| **Ordered List** | `<ol>` | [cite_start]Displays a numbered list[cite: 161, 162]. |
| **List Item** | `<li>` | [cite_start]Used for individual items in both unordered and ordered lists[cite: 158, 163]. |

---

## üìä Tables
[cite_start]Tables are used to represent real-life table data[cite: 167].

| Element | Tag | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Table** | `<table>` | [cite_start]The container for all table content[cite: 175]. |
| **Table Row** | `<tr>` | [cite_start]Used to display a table row[cite: 168]. |
| **Table Data** | `<td>` | [cite_start]Used to display the data within a table cell[cite: 170]. |
| **Table Header** | `<th>` | [cite_start]Used to display a table header[cite: 172]. |
| **Caption** | `<caption>` | [cite_start]Adds a caption to the table[cite: 191]. |
| **Table Head** | `<thead>` | [cite_start]Used to wrap the table's header content[cite: 195]. |
| **Table Body** | `<tbody>` | [cite_start]Used to wrap the table's body content[cite: 195]. |
| **Attribute** | `colspan` | [cite_start]Creates cells that span across multiple columns[cite: 198, 199]. |

üìù Forms and User Input

### üìù Forms and User Input

[cite_start]**Forms (`<form>`)** are used to collect data from users, such as for sign-ups or login pages[cite: 206, 207].

[cite_start]The **`action`** attribute in the `<form>` tag defines what needs to be performed when a form is submitted[cite: 212, 213].

Here are some common form elements:

- [cite_start]**`Input` (`<input>`)**: A common form element for user input[cite: 215].
  - [cite_start]The **`type`** attribute specifies the input type, like `"text"` or `"radio"`[cite: 216, 219, 223].
  - [cite_start]The **`placeholder`** attribute provides a hint to the user[cite: 216].

- [cite_start]**`Label` (`<label>`)**: Used to associate a label with a form control[cite: 218].

- [cite_start]**`Checkbox` (`<input type="checkbox">`)**: Allows users to select one or more options[cite: 231].

- [cite_start]**`Textarea` (`<textarea>`)**: Creates a multi-line text input area[cite: 239].

- [cite_start]**`Select` (`<select>`)**: Creates a dropdown list with multiple `<option>` tags[cite: 242].

üé¨ Multimedia and Embedding

Iframe (<iframe>): Used to embed another website within your own webpage.


Video (<video>): Used to embed a video. It has several attributes, including:


controls: Adds video controls like play and pause.


height and width: Sets the dimensions of the video.


loop: Makes the video repeat.


autoplay: Automatically plays the video when the page loads.






i want to underline a specific word in readme.md at my github so suggest me shortcutkeys to underline and many other shortcutkeys with their references


GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) does not have a dedicated shortcut key or native syntax for underlining text. However, you can use HTML tags directly within your Markdown file to achieve this.

Underline Text in Markdown
To underline a specific word or phrase, use the <u> HTML tag:

HTML

This is some <u>underlined text</u>.
Other Useful Markdown & HTML Shortcuts
While there are no universal "shortcut keys" like you'd find in a word processor, you can use the following Markdown syntax and HTML tags to format your text.

Emphasis

Bold: Use two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) around the text.

**bold text** or __bold text__

Italic: Use a single asterisk (*) or a single underscore (_) around the text.

*italic text* or _italic text_

Strikethrough: Use two tildes (~~) around the text.

~~strikethrough text~~

Headings
Use the hash symbol (#) followed by a space at the beginning of a line to create headings. The number of hashes determines the heading level (1-6).

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

Lists

Unordered List: Use an asterisk (*), a plus sign (+), or a hyphen (-) followed by a space.

* Item 1

+ Item 2

Ordered List: Use a number followed by a period (.) and a space.

1. First item

2. Second item

Links & Images

Links: Use square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL.

[Link Text](https://www.example.com)

Images: Add an exclamation mark (!) before the link syntax.

![Alt Text](image_url.jpg)

Code

Inline Code: Use a single backtick (`) around the text.

This is some code within a sentence.

Code Block: Use three backticks (```) on the lines before and after the code. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting.

JavaScript

// Your code here
Horizontal Rule

Use three hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.






not in html in .md language


There is no native Markdown syntax for underlining text. However, you can achieve this by directly using HTML tags within your Markdown file, as Markdown is designed to be a superset of HTML.

Underlining in Markdown
To underline text in a Markdown file, you can use the HTML <u> tag.

Markdown

This is an <u>underlined</u> word.
This is the standard and most reliable method for underlining text in a .md file on platforms like GitHub.

Other Markdown Formatting
While underlining isn't a direct Markdown feature, here are some common formatting options with their respective syntax:

Bold: **text** or __text__

Italic: *text* or _text_

Bold and Italic: ***text***

Strikethrough: ~~text~~

Headings: Use # for heading 1, ## for heading 2, and so on, up to ######.

Lists:

Unordered: Use *, +, or - followed by a space.

Ordered: Use 1., 2., 3., etc.

Code:

Inline code: Use a single backtick (`).

Code block: Use three backticks (````).

Links: [Link Text](https://example.com)

Images: ![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)

Blockquotes: Use > at the beginning of the line.

For more advanced formatting, such as changing font size or color, you will also need to use HTML and CSS directly within your Markdown file.
